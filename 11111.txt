I have a wordpress blog called raiatec.com that works fine on windows 10 and xampp and also a fresh install of next js that works properly and I want to build my front end on it using the wordpress api.
Please write me the code of the following parts:
1- pages/index.js
2- pages/posts/[post-slug].js
3- ~/api/getPosts.js
4- .env.local
Also, if another file is needed for the program to work, write to me.
