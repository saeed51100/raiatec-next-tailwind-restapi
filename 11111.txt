I have a WordPress site at www.raiatec.com that I use as a backend.
I have built the frontend of the application with next.js on localhost:3000 of my computer, which receives data from the api of my WordPress site, and everything works correctly.
Now I want to deploy the next.js program in xampp windows program on localhost:80.
To deploy using the Static Exports method, I have entered the output: 'export' command in nextConfig and executed the npm run build command and the "out" folder was created in my project.
Now, what should I do to run the next.js project from localhost:80?
