Your code is mostly well-structured, but there are a few ways you could optimize it.

Here are some suggestions:

Your MenuTop component can be made more declarative by creating two separate functions for
opening and closing the sidebar. This makes your code easier to read and understand.
You have a comment in your Modal component mentioning that it can be swapped with another
sidebar. If this is a common operation, consider passing the sidebar as a prop to make this
easier and more modular.
Your Modal component can be further broken down into smaller components, such as ModalBackground
and Sidebar, to make it easier to maintain and understand.
Your Navbar component can also be broken down into smaller components, such as Logo and
OpenSidebarButton.
Inline comments can be used to describe the purpose of the code.
Use useCallback hook to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Here're the optimized versions of your components:

This refactoring makes your code more modular and easier to understand, and separates the
concerns of each component. It also makes reusing components and testing each component
individually easier.
