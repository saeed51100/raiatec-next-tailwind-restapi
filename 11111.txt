In my next.js program, I use the following code in the .env file to fetch the data and the program works correctly:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://raiatec.com/wp-json/wp/v2
Now I want to fetch data from localhost/test.raiatec.com instead of raiatec.com. Therefore, I changed the .env file as follows:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost/test.raiatec.com/wp-json/wp/v2
Now my question is, how should I change the following next.config.js file in order for the image settings to work correctly?

// next.config.js
/** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
   images: {
     remotePatterns: [
       {
         protocol: "https",
         hostname: "raiatec.com"
       }
     ]
   }
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
