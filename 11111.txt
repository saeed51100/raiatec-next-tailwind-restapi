I have run my WordPress site on Windows 10 xampp localhost and it is working properly.
On the other hand, I have installed the next.js program on Windows 10's node.js and using the api, I have created the front end of my WordPress site in next.js.
That is, the backend is WordPress and runs on localhost, and the frontend is next.js on node.
Now I want to deploy the next.js project on the local host.
what should I do?
