In the next.js code below, I have placed a chevron icon in front of {category.name}.

<div className="">{category.name}</div>
<span
    className={`transition transform ${
        openAccordion === category.id
            ? "-rotate-90"
            : "rotate-0"
    }`}
>
<svg
    fill="none"
    height="24"
    shapeRendering="geometricPrecision"
    stroke="currentColor"
    strokeLinecap="round"
    strokeLinejoin="round"
    strokeWidth="1.5"
    viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    width="24"
>
  <path d="M15,6l-6,6l6,6"/>
</svg>
</span>

The problem is that they are not exactly facing each other and it needs vertical alignment.
Please, considering that I use tailwindcss for styling, give the appropriate class to {category.name} to make it a little higher.
