I have a wordpress site with a few posts and an about page.
I use next.js for frontend and get data from wordpress with below link (without installing any wordpress api plugin):
'http://localhost/test.raiatec.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts'

I want to fetch the data with the swr library and in the api/getPost file and also show the list of posts
in the components/grid/index.js file.
Please write me their code.
