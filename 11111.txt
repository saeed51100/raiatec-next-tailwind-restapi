I have installed a WordPress site on xampp Windows 10 which works fine on localhost.
In addition, I have also installed the next.js program to create a front-end on node.js in Windows, which works correctly by connecting to the api of a WordPress site with the following link:
// .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost/test.raiatec.com/wp-json/wp/v2

Now I want to deploy the next.js program on xampp.
In the next.js program, I have executed the npm run build command and the .next folder has been created and is ready to deploy.
Next, what should I do to deploy on xampp?
