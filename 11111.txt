I have a wordpress blog with some posts that works fine on windows 10 and xampp.
Now I have also installed next js which is working and I want to build my front end site in it.
In other words, I want to display data in next js with wp rest api.
Considering that I have a fresh installation of next js, please create a suitable folder
structure for the project and the necessary codes to show the list of post titles.
