I am using tailwindcss in nextjs application.
I have installed tailwindcss and it works properly with nuxtjs.
It is written in one of the tailwindcss codes:
{/*
        This example requires updating your template:

        ```
        <html class="h-full bg-white">
        <body class="h-full">
        ```
      */}

How should I do it?
