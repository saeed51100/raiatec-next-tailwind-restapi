I have a wordpress site called raiatec.com with some posts that works fine on
win 10 and xampp. I also have a fresh installation of next js with which I want
to retrieve data from wp rest api and build my front end site with next js.
I want to fetch the data with axios and show the posts in the pages folder and
the index.js file.
Please write me its code.
