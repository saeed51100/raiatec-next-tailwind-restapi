I have a wordpress site with some posts
  I use the nextjs program for the front end and the data by
'http://localhost/test.raiatec.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts'
I get it without installing any WordPress plugin.
Now that I am writing the nextjs program, I have the following question:
  Where should be the entry point in the nextjs program?
Like the nuxt program, should the starting point be in the root of the program, such
as app.vue, or can it be from the pages folder and the index.js file?
What approach is right for me?
