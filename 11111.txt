I have a wordpress site called raiatec.com with a few posts that works fine on win 10 and xampp. I also have a fresh install of nextjs and want to build my frontend site there.
I want to retrieve data from:
http://localhost/test.raiatec.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts
and without using the wp rest api plugin.
i want show posts in pages/index.js
Please write me its code.
