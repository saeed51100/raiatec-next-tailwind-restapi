I have a wordpress site with a few posts page.
I use next.js for frontend and get data from wordpress with below link (without installing any wordpress api plugin):
'http://localhost/test.raiatec.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts'

I want to fetch data with swr library and also show list of posts.
Please write me the code of the following files:
1- api/getPost.js
2- components/grid/index.js
3- pages/index.js
