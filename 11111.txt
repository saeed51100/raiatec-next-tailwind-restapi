In the next.js program, I use the following file to show a single post:

// api/usePosts.js

import useSWR from 'swr';

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;

// Function to fetch a single post by its slug
export function usePostBySlug(slug) {
    const apiUrl = `${API_URL}/posts?slug=${slug}`;
    console.log(apiUrl);
    const {data, error} = useSWR(apiUrl, fetcher);

    return {
        post: data && data[0], // Assuming the slug is unique, so we take the first post found
        isLoading: !error && !data,
        isError: error,
    };
}


the usePostBySlug function has a parameter called slug, which should be
extracted from the current post and passed to it.
Complete the code so that the slug of the current post is obtained and sent
to the usePostBySlug function.
I show a single post with pages/[post-slug].js
